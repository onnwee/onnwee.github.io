# DEPRECATED: schema.sql

This file is kept for reference only.

The project now uses versioned migrations in the `migrations/` directory.

To apply schema changes:
1. Create a new migration: `make migrate-create NAME=your_change_name`
2. Edit the generated .up.sql and .down.sql files
3. Apply the migration: `make migrate-up`

See the main README.md for full migration documentation.
